# 🚀 **Advanced Python Learning Series: From Basics to Real Projects**

### 📣 Announcement

I am excited to announce the **Advanced Python Learning Series**, designed to equip you with the practical skills needed to build real-world projects using Python. This series is ideal for those who already have a foundational understanding of Python and are ready to take the next step toward mastery.

We’ll cover **five main projects** — two basic, two intermediate, and one advanced — plus a **bonus automation project**.

---

## 🎯 **What You'll Learn**

This course is **project-driven**, which means you'll build actual applications while learning advanced concepts like:

* Data handling and analysis
* Web scraping and automation
* Machine learning and NLP (Natural Language Processing)
* Deep learning with LSTM
* Software testing using Selenium

---

## 📚 **Prerequisites**

To follow along successfully, students should have:

* A solid understanding of Python fundamentals (functions, loops, data structures)
* Basic knowledge of libraries like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `requests`
* Familiarity with Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
* Optional but helpful: Basic understanding of machine learning

If you're not confident yet, spend some time brushing up these skills before joining.
